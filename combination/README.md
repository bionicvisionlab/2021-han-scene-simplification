### Combining Saliency, Segmentation, Depth Maps

1. The combination videos are made by combining saliency and segmentation masks first, then cropping the depth maps as background.

2. Once you have videos from saliency, segmentation, and depth ready, you can create the combination video by running Make_Combination_Videos.ipynb.

Enjoy!
