### Creating Segmentation Video

1. We used a combination of of scene parsing algorithm from MIT scene parsing benchmark and object segmentation algorithm detectron2.

2. Once you have the path to the original video frames, you will be able to create segmented videos by running Segmentation_Videos.ipynb

Enjoy!
